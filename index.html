            <h4>July 29, 2017</h4>

            <p class="thumbnail"><img src="img/appstorechart.jpg" alt="downloads"/></p>

            <p class="text-justify">I made the app free indefinitely to get the number of downloads required for the Udavity VR capstone project. The curious thing about this chart is the number of downloads from China -- I'm not advertising there at all, so that's all organic traffic. </p>

            <h4>July 22, 2017</h4>

            <div class="youtube-player" data-id="XjYpvI7MRSY"></div>

            <p class="text-justify">Here's a little hand-drawn cartoon ad that I created in Sketchbook Pro over the course of about a week.</p>

            <h4>July 18, 2017</h4>

            <p class="thumbnail"><img src="img/badsales.jpg" alt="sales"/></p>

            <p>(<a href="https://www.toonpool.com/user/49862/files/3d_sales_1666495.jpg" alt="source">Image source</a>)</p>

             <p class="text-justify">I never took the advertising profession seriously. Engineers, doctors, scientists are all fine, lawyers are starting to get iffy but ... admen? Nah, not much of an occupation. </p>

             <p class="text-justify">Turns out effective advertising is hard. Really hard, especially on a tiny budget. VR Fire Escape got released on July the 8th and I started running ads on the 11th. Here's what I tried: </p>

            <ul class="left-align">
              <li>Google AdWords (2 campaigns)</li>
              <li>Apple Search Ads</li>
              <li>Reddit ads</li>
              <li>LinkedIn ads</li>
            </ul>

             <p class="text-justify">Thousands of impressions on all platforms, over a hundred clicks in AdWords and ... 0 downloads. I know because I have a pretty good idea about who bought the first 7 copies of the app. Yup, just 7 sales after four months of weekends and weeknights at Starbucks. </p>

             <p class="text-justify">This reminds me of a time I went to interview for what I thought was a tech position but was instead a sales job. The company owner and I had a lovely chat about the future of technology -- she asked what's the next big thing and I said drones -- and we both agreed I'm not the right person to sell people life insurance.</p>


            <h4>July 9, 2017</h4>

            <p class="text-justify">VR Fire Escape is now available in the App Store! The first build got kicked out because of a strange message about the app not running so well on an iPad -- of course, because it can't and that's what the Xcode build settings said -- but anyway, the second build went through because I added telephony to ensure this would be an iPhone-only game. </p>

          </div>

   			   <p class="text-justify">Fire Escape RC1 is finally ready to go! I spent most of the day uploading and reuploading application assets to iTunes Connect. As soon as Apple finishes processing the distribution build, I'll press the big "Submit for Review" button and off it will go into Appleland. There wasn't a dedicated space to indicate this is a Google VR game 'cause, I guess, they aren't expecting to get too many of those. </p>

          <p class="text-justify"> I put it in one of the fields and am hoping that the reviewer(s) will see it and put the VR icon on the game if it gets approved. </p>

   			   <p class="text-justify">I spent the last few days on getting the baked lighting right and on the fireball animation.</p>

          <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="img/outsideview.png" alt="graphic">
          </div>

	         <p class="text-justify">The lighting turned out nicely and it's not slowing down the game. The only downside is the large footprint (2.9 GB and that's after weeding out all unnecessary assets). </p>

	         <p class="text-justify">Limited user testing has showed that users are generally excited about the game and are getting a kick out of it. It takes them a while to figure out how to use Cardboard, so I've added audio instructions in addition to on-screen text. </p>

	         <p class="text-justify">Here's hoping for approval for Apple. It's my first time submitting, so I'm not sure what to expect. </p>

           <p class="text-justify">The next step is to build for my low-end Android test device and to see if the game will run at all. Still love ya Google, just don't have a Daydream-compatible phone yet...</p>

            <h4>May 29, 2017</h4>

            <p class="text-justify">
              Fire Escape is my most complex Cardboard project yet. It's been over three months since
              I started working on it and I am on the third iteration of the house and elevator models,
              which are central to the game. The goal is simple: the player needs to rescue his
              pet guinea pigs from a burning house.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              In "Die Hard", there's an elevator shaft scene where a fireball almost
              engulfs Kevin Costner's character. So I thought, wouldn't it be cool to recreate at least
              some of this in mobile VR? And off I went, spending a lot of
              time looking at elevator models online (because my Blender modeling skills are not
              that advanced yet).
            </p>

           <p class="text-justify">
              It turned out that the big challenge was to integrate the elevator into the mesh of a house.
              The following are screenshots of the first two attempts:
            </p>

            <!-- column -->
            <div class="col-lg-6">

                <img src="img/CombiningModels.png" alt="graphic">
              </div>
            </div>

            <!-- column -->
            <div class="col-lg-6">
              <div class="thumbnail">
                <img src="img/house_outside_attempt2.png" alt="graphic">
              </div>
            </div>

          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">

            <p class="text-justify">
              The model on the top was modified in SketchUp and imported into Unity. Unfortunately, it did
              not look good in Unity in several places and patching the mesh with a plane here and there
              made things worse.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              After several weeks of after-hours work, I was quite happy with the second iteration. There were a few awkward places around the elevator but those
              imperfections looked fine with the textures applied to the model.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              I was getting pretty close to the end: the game logic was there, the animations
              and special effects were complete and the UI was mostly done, too.  I wanted some
              in-depth design feedback before I wrapped up development and began the Apple and Google Play
              store submission process.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              Then... the universe finally gave me a break. The Udacity VR program is really my only venue for VR-related
              professional development -- not a lot of people know about VR in SC and there are certainly no startups
              (that I know of) engaged in VR application development.

              A Udacity classmate mentioned this raffle thing for discounted Google I/O 2017 tickets. I thought, yeah,
              that's a long shot but I entered anyway out of curiosity. The form said they'd charge me the price of the ticket if I won,
              blah blah.
            </p>

           <p class="text-justify">
              This was in early April. I continued working on Fire Escape. And on a Monday afternoon, I get an email
              saying congratulations, we've charged your credit card, and we'll see you in Mountain View in May.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              The last time I was in Mountain View was way back in 2014 during the final phase of my co-op.
              I miss both California and that general feeling of sunny optimism that permeates
              Silicon Valley. Of course, it helped that internships didn't feel like full-time work, so there
              was time to run off and just explore.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              The I/O schedule indicated several sessions about Daydream and Tango, the augmented reality platform,
              so I booked the plane tickets and flew West.
            </p>

            <div class="thumbnail">
              <img src="img/GoogleIO2017.JPG" alt="graphic">
              <p style="color: black;">Huge thanks to Women Techmakers for the ticket!</p>
            </div>

          </div>


          <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">

            <p class="text-justify">
              Google didn't disappoint. The logistics involved in taking care of some 7,000 people
              at the event were impressive: there were contractors for transportation, food, security
              and general event organization. Multiple sessions on topics ranging from machine learning
              to marketing to IoT devices were scheduled every hour from early morning till after
              six.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              There was a small but persistent group of people interested in getting feedback about
              their VR/AR apps. I heard some bad news about releasing Fire Escape to the iPhone:
              1) the GVR SDK wasn't optimized for the iPhone and 2) there was no indication that Daydream would be available on iPhones.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              My view on this as a person with very limited financial and temporal resources is first of all, that
              I need to develop for VR with the tools that I have, not the tools that I'd like to have.
              Which means I am releasing this thing for the iPhone and for Cardboard, instead of
              waiting to get a Daydream-compatible device and the Daydream headset.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              Second, I want to reach the entire mobile market. And yes, Android has the lion's
              share of it but that doesn't mean all those iPhone users should miss out on affordable
              VR experiences. I don't know that many people who would be willing to shell
              out ~ $700 for a high-end Android device if they already have iPhones.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              I did get some feedback on Fire Escape: I need to fix the noticable lag that occurs
              in parts of the mesh and spruce up the UI.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              Since returning, I've been trying to figure out what's slowing the application down.
              All the shaders are set to mobile, so I eventually narrowed it down to the house mesh
              itself and... jettisoned it with great sadness. Here's what the third iteration of the
              house-elevator environment looks like now:
            </p>

            <div class="thumbnail">
              <img src="img/elevator_thirdincarnation.png" alt="graphic">
            </div>

          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">

            <p class="text-justify">
              This is a simpler mesh and I hope this will solve the lagging issue. I'll have to redo
              the door animations and re-arrange the guinea pig models before I build to iPhone
              but the good news is that I notice no lag in Unity play mode.

          <h2>Angelo, a 360 short film</h2>
          <h4>June 24, 2017</h4>


            <p class="text-justify">This little film took over two months of work. The idea for the script popped into my head after I listened to a radio program that talked about people hearing benevolent voices in their head. 
            I mentioned it to Denise Joyner, with whom I was working on another project at the time, and she offered to play the main character. 
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
            Denise and I went over the script a few times and talked about what filming would look like with the Gear 360 camera. We set a date for the shoot and I find a suitable location. I went to two outdoor locations, one a small park and another the grounds of a decommissioned state hospital. We were not in a position to get a formal film permit -- that requires insurance for $1,000,000! -- and it was getting to be over 90 degrees every day, so an outdoors shoot was out of question. </p>
       
            <p class="text-justify">That same day I also went to an underground cafe at an old hotel in downtown Columbia.  The cafe interior would have been suitable for the script but we decided against it because we did not know how long the shoot would take and we couldn't interfere with business, which meant we would not have any control over the ambient music's volume, people walking by, etc. 
            </p>
  
            <p class="text-justify">In the end, we filmed at the Columbia JCC for free, for which I was very grateful because we had no production budget whatsoever. The quality of the footage was good but there was too much light, so we decided to do a second filming (in my kitchen). The filming took about 5 hours, quite a bit for a 7 minute film...</p>
       
            <p class="text-justify">The second shoot went smoothly and Denise's acting was superb. One of the downsides of the 360 camera that we used was that there was no preview available and I only had a 32GB mini-SD card, which did not fit in all 7+ minutes of footage. This meant that we had several jump cuts which I worked to eliminate or mask with transitions in Adobe After Effects. </p>

            
            <p class="text-justify">So finally, after a lot of work we had a film! It's not perfect but this is my first time directing and producing one, so I'm pleased with the results.</p>
