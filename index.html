            <h2>Fire Escape Development Journal</h2>
            <h4>May 29, 2017</h4>

            <p class="text-justify">
              Fire Escape is my most complex Cardboard project yet. It's been over three months since
              I started working on it and I am on the third iteration of the house and elevator models,
              which are central to the game. The goal is simple: the player needs to rescue his
              pet guinea pigs from a burning house.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              In <u>Die Hard</u>, there's an elevator shaft scene where a fireball almost
              engulfs Kevin Costner's character. So I thought, why not throw in some special
              effects and suspense into my VR capstone project? And off I went, spending a lot of
              time looking at elevator models online (because my Blender modeling skills are not there yet).
            </p>

           <p class="text-justify">
              It turned out that the big challenge is to integrate the elevator into the mesh of a house.
              Here are screenshots of the first two attempts.
            </p>

          </div>

          <!-- column -->
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <div class="thumbnail">
              <img src="img/CombiningModels.png">
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- column -->
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <div class="thumbnail">
              <img src="img/house_outside_attempt2.png">
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">

            <p class="text-justify">
              The model on the top was modified in SketchUp and imported into Unity. Unfortunately, it did
              not look good in Unity in several places and patching the mesh with a plane here and there
              made things worse.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              After several weeks of after-hours work, I was quite happy with the second iteration that
              is on the bottom. There were a few awkward places around the elevator but those
              imperfections looked fine with the textures applied to the model.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              I was getting pretty close to the end: the game logic was there, the animations
              and special effects were complete and the UI was mostly done, too.  I wanted some
              in-depth design feedback before I wrapped up development and began the Apple and Google Play
              store submission process.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              And... the universe finally gave me a break. The Udacity VR program is really my only venue for VR-related
              professional development -- not a lot of people know about VR in SC and there are certainly no startups
              (that I know of) engaged in VR application development. </p>
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              A Udacity classmate mentioned this raffle thing for discounted Google IO 2017 tickets. I thought, yeah,
              that's a long shot but I entered anyway out of curiosity. The form said they'd charge me the price of the ticket if I won,
              blah blah.
            </p>

           <p class="text-justify">
              This was in early April. I continued working on Fire Escape. And then lo and behold, I get an email
              saying congratulations, we've charged your credit card, and we'll see you in Mountain View in May.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              The last time I was in Mountain View was way back in 2014 during the final phase of my co-op.
              I miss both the city and that general feeling of sunny optimism and opportunity that permeates
              Silicon Valley. Of course, it helped that internships did't feel like full-time work, so there
              was time to run off and just explore stuff.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              Anyway, the IO schedule indicated several sessions about Daydream and Tango, the augmented reality platform,
              so I booked the plane tickets and flew West.
            </p>

          </div>

          <!-- column -->
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <div class="thumbnail">
              <img src="img/GoogleIO2017.JPG">
              <p style="color: black;">Huge thanks to Women Techmakers for the ticket!</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">

            <p class="text-justify">
              Google didn't disappoint. The logistics involved in taking care of some 7,000 people
              at the event were impressive: there were contractors for transportation, food, security
              and general event organization. Multiple sessions on topics ranging from machine learning
              to marketing to IoT devices were scheduled every hour from early morning till after
              six.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              There was only a small but persistent group of people interested in getting feedback about
              their VR/AR apps. I heard predictable bad news about releasing Fire Escape on the iPhone:
              1) the GVR SDK wasn't optimized for the iPhone and 2) there was no indication that Daydream would be available on iPhones
              at all, ever.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              My view on this as a developer with very limited financial and temporal resources is first of all, that
              I need to develop for VR with the tools that I have, not the tools that I'd like to have.
              Which means I am releasing this thing for the iPhone and for Cardboard, instead of
              waiting to get a Daydream-compatible device and the Daydream headset.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              Second, I want to reach the entire mobile market. And yes, Android has the lion's
              share of it but that doesn't mean all those iPhone users should miss out on affordable
              VR experiences. I don't know that many people who would be willing to shell
              out ~ $700 for a high-end Android device if they already have iPhones.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              I did get some feedback on Fire Escape: I need to fix the noticable lag that occurs
              in parts of the mesh and spruce up the UI.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              Since returning, I've been trying to figure out what's slowing the application down.
              All the shaders are set to mobile, so I eventually narrowed it down to the house mesh
              itself and... jettisoned it with great sadness. Here's what the third iteration of the
              house-elevator environment looks like now.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              This is a simpler mesh and I hope this will solve the lag issue. I'll have to redo
              the door animations and re-arrange the guinea pig models before I build to iPhone
              but the good news is that I notice no lag in Unity play mode.
